Linux:
- Test other combinations (especially for sendBehind()). Tested OK: Ubuntu/GNOME and Mint/Cinnamon
- acceptInput()
    - Test in all cases:  moving, resizing, remap, close, ...
    - Is it possible to make the window completely transparent to input (click-thru) in GNOME?

Windows:
- win32gui.GetMenu() not working in Windows 11 (?!?!?!?!)
- alwaysOnTop(): Now working with GDI, not with windows using DirectDraw exclusive mode
                 The solution seems to be hooking the d3d dll and force it to draw your own application as well
                 Is this possible with Python, or combining C++ and Python???

- alwaysOnBottom(): Try to find other smarter methods to keep window at the bottom (now it's a thread)

macOS / AppleScript:
- Test in an actual macOS multi-monitor (preferably 3+ monitors) system
- In general, find a way to optimize all AppScript calls in terms of time and resources
